  <property>
    <name>oozie.service.coord.check.maximum.frequency</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>
      When true, Oozie will reject any coordinators with a frequency faster than 5 minutes.  It is not recommended to disable
      this check or submit coordinators with frequencies faster than 5 minutes: doing so can cause unintended behavior and
      additional system stress.
